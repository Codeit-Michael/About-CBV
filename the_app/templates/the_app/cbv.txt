ListView
-shows all the object

	class TaskList(ListView):
		model = Task
		template_name = 'base/tasks.html'
		context_object_name = 'tasks'
		paginate_by = 5
		ordering = ['-date_created']

*model - source model
*template_name - for templating
*context_object_name - naming the context, in function based:
	context = {'contextName':contextName}
*paginate_by & ordering - The list view also has pagination and ordering already built 
in. We can set these methods by setting their attributes like I did in the code 
example above.


DetailView
-shows all the details/information about the object

	class TaskDetail(DetailView):
		 model = Task
		 template_name = 'base/task.html'
		 context_object_name = 'task'
		 pk_url_kwarg = 'custom_pk'

*pk_url_kwarg - By default the view looks for a primary key in the url called “pk” or 
a slug field called “slug”. Both of these values can be customized with slug_field or 
“pk_url_kwarg”


CreateView
-View for creating a new object, with a response rendered by a template.
-Can only create through 

class TaskCreate(CreateView):
	model = Task
	success_url = reverse_lazy('tasks')
	template_name = 'base/form.html'
	form_class = TaskForm

*form_class - By default this view creates a model form for us based on the model we 
specify. As you can see in the example if we don't specify a model form to use, one 
will be created by fail for us after we specify the field names. We can use our own 
model form by creating a mode for and setting the “form_class attribute”.


UpdateView
-This view by default follows the same template_naming convention and form principles 
as the create view. Both views will look for the same form and template unless 
otherwise specified.


DeleteView
-as what it has on its name, for deleting objects

	class TaskDelete(DeleteView):
		model = Task
		template_name = 'base/delete.html'
		context_object_name = 'task'
		pk_url_kwarg = 'custom_pk'
