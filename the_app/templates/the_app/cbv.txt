ListView
-shows all the information about the object

	class TaskList(ListView):
		model = Task
		template_name = 'base/tasks.html'
		context_object_name = 'tasks'
		paginate_by = 5
		ordering = ['-date_created']

*model - source model
*template_name - for templating
*context_object_name - naming the context, in function based:
	context = {'contextName':contextName}
*paginate_by & ordering - The list view also has pagination and ordering already built 
in. We can set these methods by setting their attributes like I did in the code 
example above.


DetailView
-can overwrite the files
